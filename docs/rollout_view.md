The Rollout-View
================
([back to documentation](README.md))

Besides the main visualization, a rollout view of the network graph can be shown during runtime to better understand the network's temporal behavior.
The rollout view lists all neuron-pools and enrolles the network for a specifyable depth into the future. No meta-variables or sub-windows are available in rollout view.

The rollout-view is still experimental and can be startet via the statestream terminal command **rv on**.
