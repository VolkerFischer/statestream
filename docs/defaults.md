([back to documentation](README.md))

At first start up of the statestream core, some configuration files are created in the folder **~/.statestream/**.
Default values for this first setup and also if a configuration is not found in this local file can be found
in [statestream/utils/defaults.py](../statestream/utils/defaults.py).
